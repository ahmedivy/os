As the weekend approached, I decided to try my hand at baking. I followed the recipe meticulously, but when it came to separating the eggs, I ended up with eggshells in one hand and a gooey mess in the other. It was like trying to juggle slippery eels! My kitchen looked like a battlefield, flour dusting every surface, and the smoke alarm wailing in protest. At that moment, I realized that my culinary skills were about as dependable as a weather forecast in a snowstorm. I suppose my friends will be receiving 'homemade' gifts from the local bakery this year!
